# RepoDL
A jailbreak repo downloader written in python.
Note: RepoDL is currently in beta. It currently only supports repos with `Packages` file (no support for `Packages.bz2` yet)
# Requirements
RepoDL works on any platform that has python and the following modules: 
`os` (default python module), `requests`, `tqdm`.
Tested by me on iOS (both unjailbroken (pythonista) and jailbroken), macOS and Linux.
# Usage
When the needed modules are installed (`pip3 install requests tqdm`) just run the script using python: `python3 repodl.py`
