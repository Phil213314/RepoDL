# RepoDL
A cydia repo downloader written in python
Note: RepoDL is currently in beta. It currently only supports repos with `Packages` file (no support for `Packages.bz2` yet)
# Requirements
RepoDL works on any platform that has python and the requests module.
Tested by me on iOS (jailbroken), macOS and Linux.
# Usage
When requests module is installed (`pip3 install requests`) just run the script using python `python3 repodl.py`
