# RepoDL
A jailbreak repo downloader written in python.
Supports `Packages` and `Packages.bz2` based repos.
# Requirements
RepoDL works on any platform that has python3 and the following modules: 
`bz2` (default python module), `os` (default python module), `requests`, `tqdm`.
Tested by me on iOS (both unjailbroken (pythonista) and jailbroken), macOS and Linux.
# Usage
When the needed modules are installed (`pip3 install requests tqdm`) just run the script using python: `python3 repodl.py`
